# Guess-Game
Key concept applied here - Random variables, Boolean, input and output, char, string and length.

Initially created a list of words which was used for gaming to guess the words. 
Three function have been created :
1.get_random_words(for picking up the words)
2.get_num_attempts(to specify the number of attempts)
3.get_min_word_length(taking number of length of word to perform guessing)

If-else and while loop has been used effectively for catching the character to finding minimum word requirements.

A text file can also be created with different number words and number of length of words, and it can be accesed by code.
